MeterReader

This is my submission for the Ensek technical exercise, I would like to take this opportunity to thank you for the oppprtunity.
Some notes on my technical exercise:

- I went down the path of database first, thus the addition of the create database scripts. I understand there is the code first approach, but jumped in to the accounts and meter reading data done
- In validation it is stated "Reading values should be in the format NNNNN", I made the assumption that the reading value should be a number, not just a number that is 5 digits long, in reality I would as a business analyst or product owner for clarification
